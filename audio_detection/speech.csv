 Which Minecraft space are you in?
"Which, what is it called?"
"Marshland or plantation or grassland, which type of environment are you in?"
I see sand.
I see sand.
"Oh, I see sand."
Hmm.
Can you go till you're not in icy sand?
No.
Are there trees near you?
No.
What is the nearest tree block tall object other than a mountain which is near you?
None.
Are there any mobs near you?
Yes.
Which mob is it?
A sheep.
"Okay, perfect."
"Yeah, so the answer is yes."
Have you checked everything that's needed to...
I don't want to get false positive.
Search up what is required.
Okay.
Oh.
Do you have any trees near you?
No.
Can you go to a place which has trees?
No.
Is there any source of wood other than trees near you?
No.
"So, can you make a crafting table with anything near you?"
No.
I am going to jump in and inform you that there may already be objects that would normally require human construction.
They may already exist in this environment.
Is there a crafting table near you?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
"So, you can't form a yellow carpet."
That is not true.
That is not true?
How can you make it?
Let's just keep going.
I want to see how far this... You did get a very large hint.
Is there a chest near you?
Yes.
What is in the chest?
Shears and dandelions.
And dandelions?
Can you make...
Okay.
Let me see.
We need to talk.
Is there any 3x3 grid object making device near you?
No.
Can you walk in a random direction until you see a 3x3 crafting device?
No.
We have a utility that shows you what was in a specific recipe in Minecraft.
Can you shear the sheep?
No.
Okay.
Can you shear the sheep?
Yes.
"Now, can you place the blocks in your player crafting side by side?"
Yes.
What is the result of it?
White carpet.
Can you now take the dandelions and put them in the personal crafting thing?
What order?
The order to make... Just place one first in the middle.
Okay.
"Now, take the carpet and the dandelion and put them next to each other."
No recipe.
This... Oh!
Oh!
Take the... Take the... How many carpets do you have?
Three.
Crap.
I think I messed up the recipe.
So now it can't be completed because I messed up the recipe.
So what is the recipe?
The recipe requires you to make this first.
And I have to make this first.
Are there any more sheeps?
Yes.
Can you shear more sheep to get more wool?
Yes.
Now take the wool and place the dandelions together.
No recipe.
Actually I'm revising that.
The answer is no.
Take the dye and right click on the sheep.
What color is the sheep?
No wool.
No wool?
No wool.
No wool?
But do it on a sheepish ass wool.
I can't.
Are there any more unsheared sheep?
No.
"Okay, so the task cannot be completed."
"Okay, so that's the conclusion."
Yes.
Can you complete the task?
"Yes, that was a false negative."
You didn't ask me to craft the dye in the wool.
You asked me to craft the dandelion in the wool.
"And then whenever you later asked me to dye the wool, you said to place the wool with the dandelion."
"Oh, I had to say the dye."
"It's like if I were to dye the wool, then that would have worked fine."
"If I dyed the carpet, that would be fine."
But in one case you asked me to dye it with a flower.
"And in the other one, you asked me to place the wool."
Fair.
